# GDMENU Card Manager
Manage content on SD Card for Dreamcast's GDEmu/GDMenu/openMenu

For GDEMU to properly work it's required to follow a pattern when putting files on the SD Card.<br/>
If not done correctly it will take a lot of time to boot and can even fail to.<br/>
This program will save the files the proper way so you console will boot super fast!

## Features
* Multi platform. Windows/Linux/OSX

* Add/delete/rename items
* Sort alphabetically
* Sort manually by drag and drop
* Automatically rename based on folder name, file name or internal name (IP.BIN)
* Show cover image (0GDTEX.PVR)
* If using a CodeBreaker image it can detect if it's the correct one.
* Saves name.txt on each folder to keep compatibility with other managers.
* Menu is built in GDI format. Compatible with consoles that cant boot MIL-CD.
* GDI Shrinking. Can reduce file size by removing dummy data without reducing the quality.

### GDI Shrinking
Can reduce the size of the game but some games won't work properly.

The program have a blacklist with some games known to have problems after shrinking.

By default the blacklist will be used and those games will not be shrunk.

### openMenu
openMenu will display customized icon, box art and text info for each title, but it requires additional files.

openMenu DAT files should go to this app's subfolder `tools\openMenu\menu_data`.<br/>
Grab the DAT files from mrneo240's repos: [imagedb](https://github.com/mrneo240/openMenu_imagedb) and [metadb](https://github.com/mrneo240/openMenu_metadb)
